# Quantum 264

# EPILEPSY WARNING!
Running command `app0` will 

This is a retro 'home computer' fantasy console, inspired by the 8-bit home computers of the 1980s. This project will be heavily inspired by the Commodore 64 as well as the Pico-8 fantasy console. The Commodore 64 was a popular home computer in the 1980s, and the Pico-8 is a modern fantasy console that is inspired by the limitations of the 8-bit era.

I've always been fascinated by the 8-bit era of computing, and I've always wanted to create my own retro home computer. This project aims to create a fantasy console, but instead of writing a whole new emulator/engine, the limitations of the console will be enforced through the use of the Pimoroni PicoVision. This will put real hardware limitations on the console, and will make it feel more like a real 8-bit home computer. It also have extremely limited resources, which will force me to be creative with my programming. What I like about the PicoVision is that it can be programmed in MicroPython, which will provide that 'BASIC' interpreted language feel that was common in the 8-bit era, but with the added benefit of being able to use modern programming techniques.


# Why Quantum 264?
Home computers in the 80s often had futuristic sounding names, like the Commodore 64, the ZX Spectrum etc. I wanted to come up with a name that sounded like it could have been a real home computer from the 80s. The name Quantum 264 is a play on the Commodore 64, and the number 264 is a reference to the number of kilobytes of memory that the PicoVision has (since the Commodore 64 had 64 kilobytes of memory). The name Quantum also has a futuristic sound to it, which I think fits well with the 80s home computer theme.

# Planning
This project has been in the planning stages for around 2 years now. I am always on the look out for ways to implement this in ways that feel true to my vision. Things like Von Neuemann architecture, 8-bit sound, and 8-bit graphics are all things that I want to implement in this project. The PicoVision is limited in that it doesn't have Keyboard support under the MicroPython environment, so the first challenge was getting this wired up. 

# Disclaimer
This is a very early stage project, and I am still in the process of figuring out how to implement this. I will be updating this README as I make progress on this project. I have a lot of ideas for this project, but equally I have a lot of challenges to overcome. I have no idea how long this project will take, nor do I even know if it will be possible to implement everything I want to implement. But I am excited to see where this project goes.


# Hat Tip
I would first like to give a shoutout to [Abeisgoatüêê](https://github.com/abeisgoat). Without their work on the PicoVision, I may not have been inspired to start this project. They were also kind enough to provide me with some guidance and permission to use some of their work as inspiration for this project. 

I would also like to give a shoutout to the Pimoroni team for creating the PicoVision. This project would not be possible without their hardware. I would also like to give a shoutout to the Pico-8 team for creating such an awesome fantasy console. I have been inspired by their work, and I hope to create something that is equally as fun to use.
